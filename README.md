# React 16.8.x Typescript ESLint Boilerplate

TSLint was deprecated by [Palantir](https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9) in favor of ESLint. Most of the boilerplate resources that currently exist on GitHub are based on older versions of React or written without Typescript in mind. This repository provides a good starting point for using Typescript and ESLint  as a starting point for your next React project.

## Contribute  

I can't promise this will stay updated as React, Typescript, or ESLint is updated. Feel free to create a pull request if you want to add features or update dependencies. I actively watch my GitHub notifications.
